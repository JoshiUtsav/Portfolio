# PORTFOLIO

## Welcome to my portfolio—where projects come alive, bugs tremble in fear, and every commit tells a story (usually one about squashing bugs with brute force or clever hacks). If you’re here for clean code and cool projects, you’re in luck. If you’re here for the memes... well, I won’t disappoint. Let’s build something awesome, or at least something that compiles.
